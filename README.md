Detecting Spolied vs Rotten Apples # Jacob Hill, Jett Stad, and John Morris
# We plan to use a dataset of rotten vs healthy apple images. We will use a neural network in order to train the computer on how to detect if an apple is fresh or has spoiled.  We will do this by training the network to visualize different colors (RGB) and sizes in order to make a prognosis similar to that of a specialized produce worker. By doing this we hope to be able to aid and improve the accuracy and speed for farms and grocery store to identify rotten fruits improving quality and yield.
